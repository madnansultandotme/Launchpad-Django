   - A clear and short title describing the bug.
   - Steps to reproduce the issue (so we can see what went wrong).

## 💭 Suggesting New Features

Got a cool idea? We’d love to hear it!  

Before opening a new feature request:
- Check existing issues to make sure someone hasn’t already suggested the same idea.

If not, open a new issue titled:

```
Feature Request: Your Feature Idea
```

In the description, explain:
- What your feature does.
- Why it’s useful or needed.
- How you think it could be implemented (if you have suggestions).

## 🔧 Submitting Pull Requests (PRs)

If you’re ready to make changes or fix something in the code:

1. Set up the project on your local environment by following the setup instructions in the `README.md`.
2. Create a new branch for your work:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```
3. Make your changes and ensure your code follows the project’s coding style.
4. Commit and push your changes to your fork:
   ```bash
   git push origin feature/your-feature-name
   ```
5. Open a **Pull Request (PR)** to the main repository.
6. Clearly explain what you changed and why.
7. Add screenshots or examples if your update affects visuals or functionality.
